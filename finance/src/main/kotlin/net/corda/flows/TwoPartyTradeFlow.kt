/**
 * This asset trading flow implements a "delivery vs payment" type swap. It has two parties (B and S for buyer
 * and seller) and the following steps:
 *
 * 1. S sends the [StateAndRef] pointing to what they want to sell to B, along with info about the price they require
 *    B to pay. For example this has probably been agreed on an exchange.
 * 2. B sends to S a [SignedTransaction] that includes the state as input, B's cash as input, the state with the new
 *    owner key as output, and any change cash as output. It contains a single signature from B but isn't valid because
 *    it lacks a signature from S authorising movement of the asset.
 * 3. S signs it and hands the now finalised SignedWireTransaction back to B.
 *
 * Assuming no malicious termination, they both end the flow being in posession of a valid, signed transaction
 * that represents an atomic asset swap.
 *
 * Note that it's the *seller* who initiates contact with the buyer, not vice-versa as you might imagine.
 *
 * To initiate the flow, use either the [runBuyer] or [runSeller] methods, depending on which side of the trade
 * your node is taking. These methods return a future which will complete once the trade is over and a fully signed
 * transaction is available: you can either block your thread waiting for the flow to complete by using
 * [ListenableFuture.get] or more usefully, register a callback that will be invoked when the time comes.
 *
 * To see an example of how to use this class, look at the unit tests.
